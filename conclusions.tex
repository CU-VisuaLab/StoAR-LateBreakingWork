\subsection{Merging Physical \& Virtual Experiences}
We found preliminary evidence that AR can merge online and in-store experiences to benefit the consumer by preserving aspects of in-store shopping that people enjoy while adding preferred aspects of online experiences. In the initial survey, participants cited the ability to find the best price and access reviews as the most important reasons to use technology in shopping. The participants who interacted with the StoAR prototype indicated that it would allow them to better analyze product specs \emph{in situ}, compare reviews and ratings, and mediate their interactions with physical products through virtual demos.

These findings align well with prior studies in e-commerce, which demonstrate the utility of price and product comparison in online shopping. Our design-based approach confirmed important aspects of online shopping shared by participants in the initial survey. We also found that people's perceptions of how AR might benefit their decision making evolved as the prototypes grew more sophisticated. These shifting perceptions suggest that using prototypes as design prompts is beneficial for helping people envision how AR experiences might differ from conventional methods. 

\subsection{New Opportunities for Blended Experiences}
We also found evidence that AR might enable unique kinds of decision support that neither physical nor virtual experiences alone can provide. For example, our high fidelity prototype provided static summaries of the product data identified as critical in the low fidelity study. However, in the high fidelity prototype, participants expressed an additional desire to interact with the system, such as the ability to virtually ``pin'' relevant information for easy access as they navigated the store or access to specific details on demand. Participants also reported a desire to use AR to simulate their own at-home context or use case for a particular product, particularly room design and game previews.

%They felt such features would allow them to ``look at products without being at a brick and mortar store,'' prioritizing the convenience of online shopping. 
The ability to explore these simulations to virtually unbox a product would provide additional information inaccessible in traditional experiences.

These findings collectively suggest that designing mixed reality applications is not as simple as blending the best aspects of both the virtual and physical experiences. AR technologies allow new methods for supporting decision making not afforded by purely physical or virtual methods. Instead, designers must critically reflect on how AR may effectively mediate novel kinds of interactions to transcend traditional approaches and provide consumers with new forms of decision support.

\subsection{Designing for Effective Communication}
Participants in the study frequently commented on the need to carefully limit the amount of information provided by the interface. Participants want to be empowered with pertinent information, but it must be easily digestible to avoid interfering with the immediacy of the in-store experience. They expressed some concern about trying to process too much information and about the display being too distracting, inhibiting their ability to navigate the physical store. Instead, participants preferred sparsely presented information in-context, allowing them to access relevant review and product information at a glance. 

%MW: 5:58 Submission--this is commented out. Would like to put back in.
Future systems will benefit from a better understanding of the balance between information presented and visual space consumed. Our findings identify a need to understand how AR systems might balance communicative power with interaction to deliver necessary information. A lack of consensus amongst participants as to what information is ``necessary'' suggests opportunities for designing intelligent interfaces and customized experiences not available in real world environments to support individual decision making.

\subsection{Limitations \& Future Work}
Our high fidelity prototype used a simulated store display rather than a real world environment.  While this approach allowed us to conduct a preliminary evaluation of the prototype without the added complexity of instrumentation or physical obstacles, it also limits our ability to fully characterize the affordances of our prototype in practice. Previous work such as Macintyre et al. \cite{macintyre2004dart} deals with effectively prototyping augmented reality experiences. Prototyping in the intended medium yields a more rapid prototyping process than a separate device or framework.
%MW: Removed...you know why
%While we believe that the design guidance provided by our work can inform effective blended experiences, we also realize that further refining and implementing StoAR in full AR is a critical next step. 
%MW: Definitely won't include this text.  But it's good content to hang onto just in case.
%Even if not a misconception, this finding points toward use of the intended hardware in prototyping for augmented reality.  If we used an augmented reality head-mounted display, we could test for safety in addition to usability.
%This prototype represents a physical store with augmented reality content.  Several users provided feedback indicating that they did not understand the concept of prototyping augmented reality in virtual reality.  In some cases, users gave feedback perceiving the system as a virtual store to virtually navigate.  
%More effective means of prototyping augmented reality, ideally using the system's intended hardware, would eliminate some of these misconceptions. \todo{frame this in terms of trade-offs: vr gives nearly full control, but removes many of the complexities of experiencing these systems in practice. Here, it allows us to gain a sense of how people would respond to the system alone, but future work is needed to understand how these responses generalize to the noisy contexts of stores}  In some cases, these concerns may have stemmed from a lack of understanding, as users may have thought their entire view of their surroundings would be blocked by a virtual reality head-mounted display.  

In our first survey, many participants reported that they use a mobile device while in a physical store. This approach allows for people to retrieve in-depth information \emph{in situ}, but it also requires significant effort to locate and compare relevant information on the fly. Participants reported that they ``like the idea of hands-free/ambient information'' offered by HMDs over mobile devices, but were concerned about the legibility of the information presented in AR. Our future work will directly compare traditional mobile devices to the StoAR approach to better understand the trade-offs of blended and parallel methods for decision making. 

\section{Conclusion}
% First, revisit the rq and findings
We explored how understanding the trade-offs of parallel physical and virtual experiences could inform mixed reality applications in the context of retail shopping. Our findings suggest that participants appreciated the ability of mixed reality experiences to offer more rapid access to information about products while preserving the physical interactions offered by in-store experiences. Using a design-based methodology allowed potential users to envision ways that AR technologies might enable new experiences beyond those offered by physical or virtual methods alone, such as mediating evaluative interactions with products like guided demos or simulated placement.  
% Then, introduce the synthesis
Our findings, gathered throughout the design process, highlight the potential for AR in retail environments and open new avenues for understanding how we might effectively derive new AR experiences from existing processes.

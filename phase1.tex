\section{Phase 1: Online Survey}

We conducted a preliminary survey across 78 participants over social media to identify important aspects of customers' in-store and online shopping experiences. We asked participants to respond to a series of open-ended and multiple selection questions to identify the three most important pieces of information involved in their shopping decisions (Fig. \ref{figures:ShoppingFactors}), what they did and did not like about existing in-store and online shopping experiences, and ways they currently use mobile technology as part of their existing shopping experiences. We used the responses from our online survey to isolate factors of in-store and online shopping that were most important to our participants. 

We clustered responses based on similarity and found that participants appreciate the immediacy and physical interaction with products in a store. Cited drawbacks of in-store shopping included the inability to comparison shop, to get the lowest or most appropriate price, and store staff trying to influence purchase decisions.  Participants shopping online appreciate low time-to-purchase and the ability to shop any time from practically any location, but disliked the associated shipping charges and delivery wait times. These findings provided a foundation from which we engage in our design work in Phases Two and Three. \todo{DNS: Verify once this section is revised that it still sufficiently dovetails with the discussion section.}

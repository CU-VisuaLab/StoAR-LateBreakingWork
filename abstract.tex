\section{Abstract}

As much of store commerce has migrated online, consumers are growing to appreciate aspects of online shopping--in several ways more than the in-store experience.  Using the appropriate technology, one could effectively merge aspects of the in-store and online shopping experiences.  We present StoAR, a system that employs augmented reality to deliver an important subset of the online shopping experience without sacrificing aspects of the in-store experience which customers appreciate.  We have provided users with easily digestible price and review information to empower users without sacrificing the convenience of shopping in a store.  We administered surveys and user tests throughout the design process.  We conclude that augmented reality is an effective vehicle to merge online and in-store shopping experiences, providing a novel means of customer engagement.

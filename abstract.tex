Mixed reality systems offer a way to blend aspects of physical and virtual experiences. However, using MR effectively requires understanding how to seamlessly merge the benefits of different experiences into a single application. \todo{better lead-in} In this work, we use retail shopping as a case study to understand how we might design MR applications that effectively blend parallel in-store and online experiences to augment consumer decision making. Through a series of surveys, prototypes, and design evaluations, we work directly with target users to identify trade-offs of in-store and online shopping and derive a set of design considerations for how augmented reality might support consumers in traditional retail environments. 
Our findings suggest that users perceive AR as an effective means for contextualized, at-a-glance access to critical information available in online shopping, such as price comparisons and review information, while retaining the convenience and immediacy of physical interactions with products of in-store experiences.  These studies provide preliminary evidence of how AR applications might transcend traditional retail experiences through physical/virtual blended interactions unique to immersive technologies.
%As much of store commerce has migrated online, consumers are growing to appreciate aspects of online shopping--in several ways more than the in-store experience.  Using the appropriate technology, one could effectively merge aspects of the in-store and online shopping experiences.  
%We present StoAR, a system that employs augmented reality to deliver an important subset of the online shopping experience without sacrificing aspects of the in-store experience which customers appreciate.  We have provided users with  
% We administered surveys and user tests throughout the design process.  We conclude that augmented reality is an effective vehicle to merge online and in-store shopping experiences, providing a novel means of customer engagement.
